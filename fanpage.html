    <h3 style="color: white;">Biography</h3>

    <p style="color: white;"> 
      Tory Lanez is a popular Canadian rapper and singer best known for his mixtape ‘Lost Cause.’ 
      Tory was born in Toronto, Canada. His family moved to Montreal before settling permanently in Florida. 
      Tory was a rap music fan since early childhood. However, his mother’s death impacted him a lot. 
      Thus, as a teenager, he suffered from behavioral issues and was sent back to Toronto to live with his grandmother. 
      He began living independently at the age of 15. Tory released his debut mixtape, ‘T.L 2 T.O,’ in 2009. 
      The album was released on ‘YouTube.’ He also started directing his own music videos. 
      By 2014, Tory was already a famous rapper. His 2014 mixtape, ‘Lost Cause,’ became a huge hit. 
      Two singles from the album, namely, ‘Say It’ and ‘Luv,’ became particularly successful. 
      Following this success, Tory was signed by ‘Mad Love Records’ and ‘Interscope Records.’ 
      Following this, he released two studio albums, namely, ‘I Told You’ and ‘Memories Don’t Die,’ in 2016 and 2018, respectively.
      Lastly is his Chixtape 5 mixtape that released November 15, 2019.
